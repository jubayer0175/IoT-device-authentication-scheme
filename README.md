## IoT device authentication scheme using an SRAM device signature
**This can be an elementary introduction to hardware security. It has SRAM PUF and signature generation process along with some basic crypto such as hash (SHA-256)** 

 This repo contains the implementation of this paper: [Mahmod, Md Jubayer al, and Ujjwal Guin. "**A Robust, Low-Cost and Secure Authentication Scheme for IoT Applications.**" Cryptography 4.1 (2020): 8.](https://www.mdpi.com/2410-387X/4/1/8/htm)

##### Running
A simple power-up method and hamming distance is used to generate SRAM device signatures. The signature is employed in a secure authentication protocol:

![Tux, protocol](https://www.mdpi.com/cryptography/cryptography-04-00008/article_deploy/html/images/cryptography-04-00008-g002.png)
I used Arduino (mega) as ED and Pi as a gateway. During enrollment, one Arduino is used to control the power of DUT (another Arduino). DUT would need a few codes to complete the process. Load `Power_control.ino` in the power control Arduino. Run this `ID_automate_v_0.1.py` and this will tell which `.ino` needs to be loaded in the DUT. Note that you will need some circuit that can support power-on of function in DUT. I did not have much time to design a PCB, so I went with a simple relay to do that. A relay connected with power control Arduino and the relay controls the power of the DUT. 
ID_automate_v_0.1.py` has all the necessary subroutines to give you the extracted ID of the DUT. It is not a fully automatic script, so it will ask you to load some codes in the DUT (this repo has everything).

During the authentication phase run: `Gatway_v_1.py` -> this code needs to be in the Pi. The DUT is connected to the Pi using a USB cable. Careful with the COM port setting. 
##### Dependencies
Just copy the folders `./library/*`to your Arduino library directory (typically in the ./Documents/arduino/library/ in windows OS)
